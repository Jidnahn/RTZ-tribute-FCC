                <p>Albert Einstein, one of the greatest minds to ever live, was once perplexed by the speed 
                at which Arteezy was able to farm. Seemingly impossible GPMs of 800+ every game were 
                consistently observed, leading to the hypothesis that this was no fluke. Einstein spent 
                the last years of his life trying to prove the ability of Arteezy's farm existed within 
                the laws of science. Critics laughed at his efforts, claiming that Arteezy's farm was an 
                undeniable act of divine intervention. It wasn't until the end when Einstein found the answer. 
                On his deathbed, Einstein spent the last seconds of his life jotting down what is now the world's 
                most infamous scientific formula. r=tzÂ²</p>
